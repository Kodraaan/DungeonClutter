Build the dungeon as you make your way through it to go deeper. Take turns moving your character and placing an object/enemy.

Use WASD or arrow keys when itâ€™s your move. Press R to restart the level if you get stuck. Click an option on the bottom, then place it in an empty cell in the map to place an object.

Installation instructions, and instructions for making your own levels, are on the itch.io page. Have fun :)

All art, sounds, and code were made by me in 72 hours. Written in C using raylib.
